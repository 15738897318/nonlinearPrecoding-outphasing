License and Referencing

This code package is licensed under the GPLv2 license. If you in any way use this code for research that results in publications, please cite our original article K. Upadhya and S. Wesemann, "Nonlinear Precoding for Quantized Outphasing RF Chains in Massive MIMO Systems," VTC Spring 2021 Helsinki, 2021, to appear.

Purpose
This is a code package is related to the following scientific article:
K. Upadhya and S. Wesemann, "Nonlinear Precoding for Quantized Outphasing RF Chains in Massive MIMO Systems," VTC Spring 2021 Helsinki, 2021, to appear.
 

The package contains a simulation environment, based on Matlab, that reproduces all the numerical results and figures in the article. We encourage you to also perform reproducible research!

To run the simulation, set the simulation parameters in simList.csv and run simMain.m. 

To reproduce the results in the paper, run simMain.m with the simList.csv that was provided. Once all the simulations are completed, run figs12.m. Note that the simulation may take several days (we ran it on a cluster and therefore the simulation took only 2 days) and therefore we recommend that you not try to generate the figures, but rather use the code to evaluate a few data points.

Lastly, there are mistakes in some of the equations in the paper which have been listed in errata.pdf
